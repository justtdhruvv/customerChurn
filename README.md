# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## 1. Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company based on their usage data and demographics.

## 2. Dataset
The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. [Link to dataset]

## 3. Methodology
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
- Preprocessed the data by converting categorical features to numerical ones.
- Built and trained a Logistic Regression model.
- Evaluated the model using Accuracy, a Classification Report, and a Confusion Matrix.

## 4. Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 80% on the test set. The model is particularly good at identifying customers who are not likely to churn.

## 5. How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `churn_analysis.ipynb`.
